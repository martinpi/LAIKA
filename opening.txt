We walked down to the docks to breath some fresh air. Not surprisingly, the air was not fresh at all. The smell of the fresh catch of the day mixed with that of the last day, and the day before. An endless cascade of gradually worsening stenches. We sat down by the pier and opened the beer cans we had brought with us. The sun was just about to set behind the rigging of one of the ships. Without the smell it would have been a lovely scene. As it was, it felt perfect for discussing what we came here for.
